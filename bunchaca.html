        <div class="subtitle">Instructions</div>
            <p>Prepare the Ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean the tuna fish thoroughly, fillet it, and separate the bones from the meat.</li>
                    <li>Slice the pineapple. Cut the tomatoes into wedges.</li>
                    <li>Grill the shallots.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Prepare the Broth:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place a pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil. Add the tuna bones and blanch them briefly, then remove them to a plate.</li>
                    <li>In another pot, add the fish bones, grilled shallots, and pineapple slices. Simmer for 45 minutes, making sure to skim off any foam throughout the process to keep the broth clear. Keep the heat at a medium level to avoid boiling too aggressively. </li>
                    <li>After simmering, strain out the bones and shallots, leaving only the clear broth.</li>
                        <div><img id="image1" src="images/bcc.jpg" alt="bbhimage" /></div>
                    <li>Next, pour the clear broth into another pot and season it with 10g of rock sugar, 10g of monosodium glutamate, 12g of salt, and 10ml of fish sauce. Let it cook for about 5 minutes, then turn off the heat.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Making Steamed Fish:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the tuna fillets on a plate and marinate with 20g of minced ginger, 20ml of white wine, 10g of cornstarch, 10ml of fish sauce, and 8g of pepper. Sprinkle the seasonings directly onto each piece of fish and spread it evenly so that the fish absorbs the flavors well.</li>
                    <li>Next, steam the fish for 15 minutes, then remove and break it into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                        <div><img id="image1" src="images/BCC2.jpg" alt="bbhimage" /></div>
                </ul>
            <p>Making Fish Cakes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the snakehead fish in a bowl, add 10g of salt, 10ml of fish sauce, 10g of monosodium glutamate, 15ml of pepper, and 10g of chopped green onions. Mix well to ensure the fish absorbs the seasonings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> You need to knead the fish until it becomes sticky; this is essential to make the fish paste firm and tasty.</li>
                    <li>Next, divide the fish paste into two portions and steam for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Once the fish paste is steamed, take one portion and fry it until both sides are golden brown. Cut both the fried and steamed fish cakes into bite-sized pieces.</li>

            <p>Stir-fry the Tomatoes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a pan and add a little oil, then saut√© 10g of chopped onions and 10g of chopped garlic until fragrant. </li>
                    <li>Next, add the tomatoes and stir-fry them until cooked.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Serve and Enjoy!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the noodles in a bowl, then add the steamed fish, fried fish cakes, steamed fish cakes, stir-fried tomatoes, and chopped green onions on top. Pour the hot broth over the ingredients, and you're ready to enjoy!</li>
                    <li>Serve the bun cha ca with fresh herbs. You can add chili, lime, and dip the fish in salty fish sauce for extra flavor.</li>
