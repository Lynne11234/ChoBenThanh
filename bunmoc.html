            <p>Prepare the Ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse the bone marrow and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Then, blanch the bones in boiling water to remove any impurities.</li>
                    <li>Note: Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water for blanching.
                        For the pork ribs, blanch them in boiling water the same way as the bone marrow.</li>
                    <li>After blanching the bone marrow and pork ribs, rinse them with cold water and let them drain.</li>
                    <li>Cut the lean pork into thin slices. Peel 3 shallots and finely chop the rest.</li>
                    <li>Soak the wood ear mushrooms in cold water until fully expanded, drain, and chop them into small pieces. To reduce the musty odor, rub the mushrooms with salt before rinsing.</li>
                    <li>Chop the cilantro and green onions into small pieces. Slice the pork sausage into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Prepare the Broth:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the bone marrow and pork ribs into a pot with about 1.5 liters of cold water and bring it to a boil. Remember to add 3 shallots to the pot to enhance the flavor of the broth. </li>
                    <li>Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. During the simmering process, you can skim off the foam to make the broth clearer.</li>
                    <li>Season the broth with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of seasoning powder.</li>
                    <div class="subject animation"><img id="image1" src="images/bmo.jpg" alt="bmoimage" /></div>
                </ul>
            <p>Prepare the Meatballs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the minced shallots and all the ground meat into a mortar and pound until finely ground. Once the meat is thoroughly pounded, season with ¼ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of seasoning powder, and ½ teaspoon of pepper. </li>
                    <li>Continue pounding to ensure the seasoning is evenly mixed into the meat. Transfer the finely ground meat to a bowl and mix it with the soaked and chopped wood ear mushrooms, then stir well.</li>
                    <li>Use 2 teaspoons to shape the meatballs into round forms, or you can shape them directly with your hands. Once the meatballs are formed, drop them into the simmering broth.</li>
                    <li>Finally, season the broth with 1 tablespoon of fish sauce and quickly turn off the heat. The fish sauce will enhance the fragrance and richness of the broth.</li>
                        <div class="subject animation"><img id="image1" src="images/bmo2.jpg" alt="bmo2image" /></div>
                </ul>
        <div class="subtitle" >Serve and enjoy the dish!</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the noodles into a bowl, add 2 slices of Vietnamese pork sausage (chả lụa), then pour the broth into the bowl along with the spare ribs and meatballs. </li>
                    <li>Finally, sprinkle chopped herbs on top and enjoy with fresh vegetables, adding fermented shrimp paste (mắm tôm) to taste.</li>
                </ul>
