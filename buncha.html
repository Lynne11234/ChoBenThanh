            <p>Make the Caramel Sauce for Marinating the Meat</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add about 3 tablespoons of sugar to a pan with a little water. Heat it until the sugar turns amber. Then, add a bit more water and bring it to a boil to combine the water and sugar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Note: </strong>Do not let the sugar burn too much, as it will make the grilled meat look unattractive.</li>
                    <li>Clean the pork belly, scrape off any impurities, and slice it into thin, even pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Marinate the Meat</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix the pork with a marinade made from: 1 tablespoon of seasoning powder, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of caramelized sugar, chopped shallots, and garlic.</li>
                    <li>Let it marinate for about 2 to 3 hours. If you have honey, add it to the marinade as it will make the grilled meat more fragrant and give it a better color.</li>
                    <li>Grind the pork shoulder (or chop finely) and marinate it the same way as the pork belly. Store both meats in separate containers in the fridge for 3-4 hours.</li>
                    <li>If you're making the dish for lunch, marinate the meat in the morning or marinate it in the afternoon for an evening meal. You can also marinate the meat overnight, which will make the meat even more tender and flavorful.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Prepare the Dipping Sauce</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peel the carrots and cucumbers. For the cucumber, remove the seeds and either carve it into flowers or slice it thinly.</li>
                    <li>Mix the cucumber with 1 tablespoon of salt, stir well to draw out excess water, then drain.</li>
                    <li>Combine the cucumber with sugar, vinegar, and minced garlic in a bowl and let it marinate. You can replace the cucumber with kohlrabi or green papaya if desired.</li>
                    <li>For the dipping sauce, use an amount of water roughly equal to the quantity you need for the sauce. Add sugar (or MSG), minced garlic, vinegar, and lime juice, and mix to create a balanced sweet and sour base.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add fish sauce, adjusting to achieve the perfect balance of sour, sweet, salty, and spicy.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated cucumber and carrots into the sauce, and optionally add sliced fresh chili for extra heat.</li>
                    <li>For the herbs, use lettuce, perilla, mint, Thai basil, and soaked bean sprouts. Wash and dry them thoroughly.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Grill the meat</p>
                <ul>
                    <div class="subject animation"><img id="image1" src="images/bc.jpg" alt="bcimage" /></div>
                    <li>Shape the ground pork into small, even-sized meatballs, and arrange them on a grilling rack. Grill over charcoal until both sides are golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Grill the meatballs and the flat pork separately to ensure the meat cooks evenly. Since the pork is marinated with oyster sauce, it won’t dry out or burn during grilling, resulting in a soft texture and a beautiful brown color.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, you can use an oven to grill the meat, which is cleaner and prevents smoke. The meat will cook evenly and turn golden brown without burning.</li>
                    <li>For oven grilling, place the pork belly on a rack in the oven, setting it at an angle to allow the door to close completely. Place a piece of aluminum foil in the remaining space, and arrange the meatballs on top to grill at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to about 220°C (428°F) until it is very hot, then place the meat in to grill both top and bottom for about 10 minutes. Use chopsticks to flip the meatballs to ensure both sides are evenly browned. The flat pieces of pork may not need flipping, as grilling on both top and bottom will ensure they cook evenly.</li>
                </ul>
        <div class="subtitle" >Serve and enjoy the dish!</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve the bún (noodles), chả (grilled pork), and fresh herbs on a plate. Add the pickled vegetables (dưa góp) on the side to enjoy with the chả and dipping sauce.</li>
                </ul>
